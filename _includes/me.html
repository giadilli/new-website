<h2 id="about">about</h2>

<p>I am a philosopher working on how ethical theory, cultural values, and social norms shape the behavior of artificial intelligence systems, with a focus on conversational agents and large language models. I hold a PhD in Philosophy from <a href="https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/">Sorbonne Université</a> - <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/fr">CNRS</a>, where my research examined the ethics of conversational AI at the intersection of moral philosophy and machine learning.</p>

<p>I currently work in the science team at <a href="https://mistral.ai/">Mistral AI</a>, focusing on model behavior, with particular attention to cultural and multilingual alignment. Prior to this, I spent nearly four years at <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a> as Principal Ethicist, conducting interdisciplinary research on AI ethics at the intersection of philosophy, machine learning, and deployment practices. Before moving into AI research, I worked on human rights policy at the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a>.</p>

<p>My research draws on centuries of moral philosophy to interrogate how AI systems are designed, aligned, and evaluated as they move beyond instruments and start occupying social and relational roles, including emerging forms of AI companionship. I have worked on conversational AI since 2017, approaching it as both a technical system and a social phenomenon embedded in everyday life. I am particularly interested in how AI shapes social relations at multiple scales—from individual interactions to collective and population-level dynamics—which motivates my focus on human–AI interaction in multilingual and multicultural contexts. Across this work, I engage with questions of evaluation, governance, safety, and AI ethics, aiming to connect philosophical analysis with the concrete realities of how AI systems are built and deployed.</p>

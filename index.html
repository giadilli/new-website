            <p>I am a philosopher working on how cultural values and social norms shape the behavior of artificial intelligence systems, with a focus on conversational agents and large language models. I hold a PhD in Philosophy from <a href="https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/">Sorbonne Université</a> - <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/fr">CNRS</a>, where my research examined the ethics of conversational AI at the intersection of moral philosophy and machine learning.</p>
            <p>I currently work in the science team at <a href="https://mistral.ai/">Mistral AI</a>, focusing on model behavior, with particular attention to cultural and multilingual alignment. Prior to this, I spent nearly four years at <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a> as Principal Ethicist, conducting interdisciplinary research on AI ethics in open source settings. Before moving into AI research, I worked on human rights policy at the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a>.</p>

        <p>My work draws on centuries of moral philosophy to explore how AI systems are designed, aligned, and evaluated as they move beyond being simple tools and begin to take on social and relational roles, including emerging forms of AI companionship. I have been working on conversational AI since 2017, treating it as a sociotechnical system. In this context, I am especially interested in how AI shapes social relations at different levels, from individual interactions to broader collective and population dynamics. More broadly, I work on questions of human-AI interaction, AI evaluation, governance, safety, and AI ethics, always trying to connect philosophical reflection with how AI systems are actually developed and deployed.</p>
